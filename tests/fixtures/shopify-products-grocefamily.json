Our just chicken CSA will run for six months and will include whole chickens and/or chicken cuts monthly, depending on which package you choose. You win with our chicken CSA because you won't need to buy a new freezer to get a discount or to avoid finding that your favorites have gone out of stock.</p>\n<p>We call our chicken \"actually free range\" because the animal husbandry practices of our chicken raising system go well above and beyond the standards of \"free range\" and \"pastured\" systems. Our chickens enjoy fresh non-GMO feed and freedom in wide-open pastures for most of their lives on our farm. This mean that our chickens do plenty of foraging in our lush diverse pastures full of clover, grass and bugs. More time and space for foraging means more flavor and nutrients in your chicken; Not to mention happier chickens, and healthier land, air, and water.</p>\n<p>As always, our animals are never fed genetically modified organisms. They are bred to thrive outdoors, and do live their lives outdoors, roaming and foraging from our fresh rotating pastures and forests. </p>\n<p>We pledge to make sure that each month you receive 20% more chicken than you would if you spent the same amount at our retail booth. We offer three sizes to choose from, priced at $45, $70, and $120 per month. Feel free to pay all up front or pay half up front.  The other half will be split up between the six monthly pickups. </p>\n<p>NEW!: We are also now offering a All Chicken Cuts offering for those who would prefer to not work with whole birds.

We work with a hand full of butchers in the area to add in their skill and resources to our work so that we can provide the best tasting products with the cleanest labels possible. Along the way though, we've run into folks looking to eliminate even small amounts of things like sugar, nitrates, or label terms such as \"spices\", which leave some ambiguity. </p>\n<p>So now we are offering a similar monthly variety bundle. But instead of including the widest variety of sausages, cured meats, and brats, we're offering a CSA with just plain ground products and whole-tissue meat.  </p>\n<p><span></span>This, and all our Community Supported Agriculture Program members can rely upon us for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discounted but consistent access to the best pastured meats.</li>\n<li>Wide variety of pasture raised chicken turkey and pork; and grass fed beef.</li>\n<li>Convenient monthly drop-off locations.</li>\n<li>NOW OFFERING home delivery option!</li>\n<li>No need to buy a new freezer to get a discount or to avoid having your favorites go out of stock.</li>\n<li>Each month receive at least 20% more than if you spent the same amount at our retail booth.</li>\n<li>Three sizes to choose from: priced at $90, $120, and $165 per month.</li>\n<li>You eat every day.

The original Thanksgiving feast had at its center a turkey who spent all year in the woods and meadows, searching for fruits, nuts, bugs, and grass. This year you can recapture that classic American tradition with one of our free-roaming pastured turkeys. <br></p>\n<p><span>This year we are offering three sizes of turkey, at three set prices: </span></p>\n<p><span>Small: 9-13.99 lbs for $89</span></p>\n<p><span>Medium: 14-18.99 lbs for $109</span></p>\n<p><span>Large: 19-24 lbs for $134</span></p>\n<p><span>NEW THIS YEAR!: We are now offering an Indianapolis drop AND home delivery in our Metro Lousville six county delivery area (for an extra $12). Look for an email reminding you to put out a cooler on your porch on the Monday before Thanksgiving, and leave a note in the cart if you would like it delivered anywhere besides your billing address.</span></p>\n<p>When selecting delivery of pickup for Thanksgiving, our medium and large turkeys will be fresh, never frozen. However, some small turkeys and all turkeys after Thanksgiving will be distributed frozen. Once you reserve your turkey, your bird can be picked up at one of our drop off locations in New Albany or Louisville.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This is a full payment for a holiday turkey. Please choose from the estimated sizes. We reserve the right to provide you a larger turkey at no additional cost. </p>",
